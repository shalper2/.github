## Splunk> Platform Apps

The Platform Apps Organization is an effort by the Splunk Developer Relations team (DevRel) to collect and make available the applications and add-ons that make Splunk's platforms the most powerful and versatile tools in their fields. By making these open source we hope to foster community amongst Splunk products customers and provide an enhanced experience for users. Additionally, these repositories can act as guides or templates for users wishing to create and implement new use cases on their own Splunk deployments.

## Community Guidelines

The Splunk> Platform Apps organization follows the [Splunk Community Guidelines](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Community/current/community/CommunityGuidelines). Adhering to these guidelines when interacting with our community members will help to keep our community safe and correspondence respectful, ensuring a great experience for everyone.

## Contributing

If you are interested in contributing your App or Technical Add-On then first of all: Thanks! People like you and the work that you do is an integral part of keeping the Splunk community alive and thriving. There is a lot of work to do and your contributions make a world of difference towards our goal of a better Splunk.
