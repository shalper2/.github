# Conventions in use by `splunk-platform-apps` repositories

## Code and Style
We would ask that you adhere to the following guidelines when developing your App to ensure consistency without our platform.

### Python
Projects using Python will be expected to standardize to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). Code will be automatically linted using [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/). It is an _extremely_ good idea to lint your code with the provided [configuration](https://github.com/splunk-platform-apps/.github/tree/main/actions/lint/ruff.toml) before committing your code.

## App Naming Convention
Apps should follow the [Splunkbase naming guidelines](https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/releaseapps/splunkbase/namingguidelines/). Further details for Splunk naming conventions can be found [here](https://lantern.splunk.com/Splunk_Success_Framework/Data_Management/Naming_conventions).
